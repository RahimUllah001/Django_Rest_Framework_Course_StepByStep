from django_filters.rest_framework import DjangoFilterBackend
# Create your views here.

and in evry view will add this line ==>     filter_backends = [DjangoFilterBackend]


class StudentList(ListAPIView):
    # queryset = Student.objects.filter(passbywhome="fahim")
    queryset = Student.objects.all()
    serializer_class = StudentSerializer
    filter_backends = [DjangoFilterBackend]

from rest_framework.filters import SearchFilter
# Create your views here.
when we want like search or partial search 

class StudentList(ListAPIView):
    # queryset = Student.objects.filter(passbywhome="fahim")
    queryset = Student.objects.all()
    serializer_class = StudentSerializer
   filter_backends = [SearchFilter]
    # search_fields = ['name']  # Partial match this do partial match e.g 'like' conditin in sql 
    search_fields = ['^name']  # this is regex wheren name start with specific letter
