Great question! Let's break it down so you fully understand why we use ViewSets and how they compare to other approaches like Generic API Views and Function-Based Views (FBVs).

1️⃣ What is a ViewSet?
A ViewSet in Django REST Framework (DRF) is a way to group related API functionalities (like list, create, retrieve, update, and delete) into a single class instead of defining them separately.

🔹 Without ViewSet: You need to create separate class-based views for each action.
🔹 With ViewSet: You can handle all operations inside a single class.
