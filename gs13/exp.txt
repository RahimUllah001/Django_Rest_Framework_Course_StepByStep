Token authentication in django rest framework

one way to genrerate token is directly creating token in django admin table in token table
2nd way is in termina by comand e.g python3 manage.py drf_create_token user1

3rd way is by exposing api endpoint 
we achieve this by addin the below line code to url.py a nd then writting some command in terminal
from rest_framework.authtoken.views import obtain_auth_token
urlpatterns = [
    path("gettoken/",obtain_auth_token)
]

anf by writning this command in terminal 
http POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/gettoken/ username="user1" password="Admin@a1"


4th way 
by using signals
